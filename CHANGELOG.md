and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- Client-side `/cdn-cgi/trace` fetching for accurate WARP connection status detection
- Real-time HTTP protocol detection (HTTP/2, HTTP/3) based on actual connection type
- Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) status display in Connection Status section
- Client Hints API integration for real OS version detection (bypasses frozen User-Agent)
- In-memory IDP details caching with 1-hour TTL and LRU eviction (100 entry limit)
- ETag support for `/api/env` and `/api/idpdetails` endpoints with 304 Not Modified responses
- Favicon endpoint with 7-day caching and 204 No Content response
- Mobile DNS-only mode inference for authenticated users without device enrollment

### Changed

- WARP mode detection now uses client-side trace endpoint instead of unreliable server-side flags
- HTTP/3 protocol automatically displayed for active WARP tunnel connections
- Gateway status detection improved with multi-source validation (trace endpoint + device API)
- Device ID extraction enhanced with `device_sessions` array fallback support
- WARP mode field now nullable (null = client-side determination required)
- Public IP address displayed from client-side trace endpoint for accuracy
- OS version detection prioritizes Client Hints API over frozen User-Agent string

### Performance

- IDP details API calls reduced via module-level in-memory cache
- ETag-based conditional requests reduce bandwidth for static config endpoints
- 304 Not Modified responses for unchanged `/api/env` and `/api/idpdetails`
- Favicon request overhead eliminated with 7-day cache and 204 response

### Technical

- Async/await pattern for `displayDeviceInfo()`, `displayWarpInfo()`, `displayNetworkInfo()`
- `fetchRealWarpStatus()` utility function for client-side trace endpoint queries
- `getRealOSVersion()` utility function for Client Hints API integration
- SHA-256 ETag generation for content validation
- LRU cache eviction strategy for IDP details (FIFO with size limit)

### Security

- Client-side trace fetching preserves user's actual WARP connection context
- No server-side WARP status fetch (avoids misleading connection state)
- Private data remains isolated with user-specific cache keys

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- Cache headers across all endpoints for optimal performance
- ExecutionContext integration throughout request chain
